### `.coveragerc`

A file containing configuration settings for the [`coverage`][coverage] Python package. When executed with
[`pytest`][pytest] using the following command:

```shell
coverage run -m pytest
coverage html
```

a code coverage report in HTML will be produced on the code in the [hooks][docs-hooks], and
`{{ cookiecutter.repo_name }}/src` folders. This HTML report can be accessed at `htmlcov/index.html`.

[common configuration][gds-way-flake8] described on [The GDS Way][gds-way].
